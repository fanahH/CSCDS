Our story {#story}
===================================================



What is a data scientist
===================================================

A combination of programmoing, statistics and domain knowledge. 

I like to think of it as *story telling using data*

```{r ds_fig, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}

venn_ds = data.frame(x = c(0, 2, -2),
                     y = c(2.5, -0.5, -0.5),
                     labels = c('Math & Stats', 'Domain \nKnowledge', 'Programming')) 

ggplot(data = venn_ds, aes(x0 = x, y0 = y, r = 2.5, fill = labels)) +
  geom_circle(alpha = .3, size = 1, colour = 'grey') +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_void() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  labs(fill = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "D", discrete = TRUE) +
  annotate("text", x = venn_ds$x, y = venn_ds$y, label = venn_ds$labels, size = 8)


```

Myths about data science {#myths}
====================================================



> - Myth 1. You need a PhD to become a data scientist 


> - Myth 2. Python is the only tool used in data science


> - Myth 3. Data science == AI & machine learning


> - Myth 4. Data science is all about technical skills 




Letting the data speak! {.smaller}
===================================================
To tackle these myths, Kaggle conducts annual survey of data scientists. Almost 20,000 respondents completed the survey from over 60 countries in 2018 and 2019.
```{r respondent-plot, out.width= "65%"}

cols <- viridis(3)
cols <- substr(cols, 0, 7)

highcharter::highchart(type = "map") %>%
  highcharter::hc_add_series_map(highcharter::worldgeojson,
                    df %>% 
                      group_by(country) %>% 
                      summarise(n = n()) %>%
                      mutate(freq = round(n / sum(n),2)) %>% 
                      ungroup() %>%
                      mutate(iso2 = countrycode::countrycode(country, origin="country.name", destination="iso2c")),

Myth 4. Data science challenges are mostly analytical 
==================================================

The survey did not explicitly ask the way respondents broke up their time. So I did the next best thing... ask twitter

```{r tweet_fig, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tweet.png")
```

Data scientists challenges {.smaller}
=================================================

In 2017, the Kaggle survey asked respondents about the "biggest challenges in data science".

From here we can  see that most people identify "dirty data" the toughest part of the job. The rest of the issues seem be organizational. 

```{r challenges, out.width="60%"}

```

Gaining  more  experience: Courses 
=================================================

The American Statistical Association held a two-day Data Science summit. 72 educators, researchers and practitioners in statistics, mathematics, computer science, and data science from academia, industry, government and nonprofit gathered to put forth recommendations for future data science programs. 

Data science courses should expose students to: 

```{r what-to-learn}
rbind("Introduction to statistics", "
           Data analysis in the real world", 
           "Math and algorithms", 
           "Answering real problems", 
           "Expose students to modern tools", 
           "Teach data ethics", 
           "Active learning") %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "striped"), font_size = 20)
```

I'd add to this list: study design. Knowing how data was generated/collected will always inform the types of questions you can ask, and appropriate method of analysis. 


How to pick a learning strategy

```{r types-learning}
data.frame(Type = c("MOOC", "MOOC",

Build a portfolio
=================================================

**Showcase your work**

- [Github](https://github.com/)
- a simple personal website 
- [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/)


**Local meetups**

[RLadies](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-montreal/), [Data For Good](https://www.meetup.com/DataforGood-Montreal), [PyData](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-MTL)


**Internship**

- Get  relevant experience, learn about new industry, create a network
- Check out your university coop programs 
- Internship programs in industry [IVADO labs](https://ivado.ca/en/events/ivado-digital-intelligence-internship-and-job-fair-h2020/?utm_source=MTL+NewTech&utm_campaign=d8a1232165-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_06_20_02_54_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c6228f9f7d-d8a1232165-444123085&mc_cid=d8a1232165&mc_eid=4ec14ee0c5), [Plotly](https://boards.greenhouse.io/plotly)



*Don't forget to reach out to your network and tell people you're looking to get into a new industry*


Preparing your cover letter and CV
=================================================



> - Use the cover letter to explain *why* you're applying for the job even if your profile doesn't perfectly match the job description
> - Instead of focusing on all the highlights of your academic career, explain WHY you want to work for that company

>- In general, keep it short and sweet (max 2 pages)
> - Academic CV != Professional CV
> - Only provide extensive details about academic experience if it is relevant
> - Tailor your CV and cover letter to each application - use key words from posting




More on CV's 
=================================================

A few tips (based on my personal pet peeves)

> - Use consistent formatting
> - If using a job aggregator site, upload your actual CV (the printout we see is very ugly)
> - Don't include abbreviations or technical jargon
> - Don't indicate that you have high proficiency in 22 programming languages
> - Don't list 30 MOOC's I *know* you didn't finish



Searching for a position
=================================================

```{r shame, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ds_shame.jpg")
```

> - Focus on the skills listed in the job positing, not the title *but be weary of descriptions* 
> - Don't expect that you will possess 100% of the stated skills; it's often a wishlist
> - Try to talk to people at those companies or seasoned data scientists to get insider perspective 



> - Be aware that many companies are jumping on the "data" bandwagon without having any infrastructure to support a junior hire
> - Many companies's job description is aspirational; often doesn't reflect the day-to-day  



During the interview
==================================================

- Expect technical questions and/or coding challenge
- Be honest about your skills
- Be mindful about expressing your desired to be paid to learn 
- Highlight the value you bring to the employer, rather than the value you accrued in university
- Be ready to explain technical concepts to non-technical people

Jacqueline Nolis's book [Build a Career in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science)

>"I want to hear about a project they’ve worked on recently. I ask them about how the project started, how they determined it was worth time and effort, their process, and their results. I also ask them about what they learned from the project. I gain a lot from answers to this question: if they can tell a narrative, how the problem related to the bigger picture, and how they tackled the hard work of doing something".

Asking for feedback after your interview can help highlight the interviewer's perceptions of your strenghs and weaknesses

Employer fears
==================================================

In general, employers are concerned that new hires without job experience will struggle to see the bigger picture and will struggle with the pace. 


```{r fears}
cbind("Undergrad & Masters" = c("No revelant experience", 
                                "Will expect a lot of  hand holding", 
                                "Training is expensive and time consuming"),
        "PhD" = c("Experience is hyperfocused", 
                  "Unaccustomed to working collaboratively",
                  "Both under- and over-qualified")) %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", position = "float_right", 
                                      font_size = 30)) %>% 
  row_spec(0, color = "#453781FF")
```

**Try to address these fears by addressing them directly in your cover letters, CV's and during the interview**

Pivoting to data science  from humanities, social sciences or any other discipling doesn't mean you need to leave all of your training behind. 

`r emo::ji("check")` You have knowledge and/or experience in at least one of these circles 

`r emo::ji("check")` Look for people in your substantive area who are doing some more quantitative/tech driven

`r emo::ji("check")` Be confident that *you* know how to learn

`r emo::ji("check")` Be ready to start at the bottom

`r emo::ji("check")` Your path is the right path
